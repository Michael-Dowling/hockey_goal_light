# hockey_goal_light
Get notified by a flashing light and LCD display connected to a Raspberry Pi whenever an NHL player scores a goal.

This is a passion project I did in 2017. I wanted to learn Java while working in an area of great interest to me. I have played hockey all
my life, and am a huge fan of the NHL, so I created a program which can run on a Raspberry Pi to notify users the instant a goal is scored
in the NHL. It also tells users the score of the game, the time in the game, the goal scorer/the assists and how they scored.
